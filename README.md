# cuepoint-manager
A Max for Live device to manage a live session built in Ableton Live's arrangement view, using cue points (aka locators) as starting cues.

A Max for Live device built for managing a sequence of events, developed to make work more agile and secure in Ableton Live's arrangement section for live shows.

The device was developed based on experiences gained from the creative and technical realization of theatrical, musical, and dance performances. It is a device that has grown and evolved over several years, reflecting my approach to production but is also reusable by others who need to execute shows with predetermined time sequences.

The device is built using cue points/locators as cues.

The device allows for keeping multiple computers in sync through a network connection in order to distribute workloads across multiple machines (audio, lights, video, etc.) and/or to use redundant machines. To do this, simply load the device on all the machines you want to connect to each other and properly configure the network (see the Network section below).

## Suggestions:
It is recommended to start with the Ableton Live demo session available in the repository to understand the device's functionality and usage.

## Network:
It is suggested to create a local network, preferably wired, for using multiple computers. For the system to work, it is sufficient to have all devices on the same subnet. If you want to use multiple computers simultaneously, it is recommended to use a broadcast address for sending control messages.
If the network connection does not work, check the correctness of its configuration and the possible presence of firewalls that may block the messages.
